## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Sass
- Tailwind
- ESLint + Prettier
- Vite


### What I learned

This is my first React project, so I am definitely happy about it. 

Through this small but important project I have learned how to use different libraries such as classnames, react-responsive, react-icons step by step. 

I have learned a basic React usage without react-router, aka SPA (Single Page Application).

### Continued development

I absolutely need to contunue reading a React documentation. I have just started to work with it so there is a myriad things to practice and learn.

There is still work with the general project preparation and configuration. I guess there are some possible issues with ESLint and Prettier configurations.

### Useful resources

- [React](https://react.dev/) - Everyone who learns React should peruse this documentation.

- [Фрілансер по життю](https://fls.guru/) - This is an amazing Ukrainian web devoloper. Here you can find useful cheetsheets for flex, background, position and so on.
